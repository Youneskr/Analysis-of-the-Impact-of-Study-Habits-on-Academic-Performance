# Study Habits Impact Analysis on Academic Performance

## Introduction
This project explores the impact of study habits on students' academic performance. It aims to understand how students manage their study time, environmental preferences, note-taking methods, and other learning processes to identify significant trends that can inform educational practices and improve academic outcomes.

## Data Collection Process
Data was collected through a survey form designed to delve into the participants' study habits. The methodology involved using social media platforms for dissemination and systematic recording of responses in a tabular format.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset includes responses from 100 participants and underwent preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, outlier management, missing value handling, and feature selection to prepare it for analysis.

## Model Selection
A linear regression model was chosen for supervised learning to predict student success based on various characteristics. The model was trained on labeled data, with the goal of understanding the relationship between study habits and academic performance.

## Regression Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error, mean squared error, and the coefficient of determination. The results indicated that the model could explain approximately 78% of the variance in the data.

## Model Interpretation
The analysis explored the predictive impact of various variables on the model's predictions[^1^][1]. It highlighted the importance of regular study hours, preferred study environments, note-taking methods, and distraction management in influencing academic success.

## Limitations and Future Perspectives
The study acknowledges the limitations of the predictive model and suggests future perspectives for enhancing the model's accuracy and applicability.

## Conclusion
The project concludes with insights into the study habits that correlate with higher academic performance and provides recommendations for improving educational practices.
